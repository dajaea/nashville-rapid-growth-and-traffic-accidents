Here is some material that I produced independently for an intro to analytics at Nashville Software School.  Some of the code used to generate graphs, as well as the final slides are attached.  My initial effort went into research identifying the most useful questions, sources and parameters for this contribution to my group, which presented more broadly on area growth and traffic.  Please write with any questions or curiosity.  This was an exciting project, but one that could not predict the vast reduction in traffic, and accidents we have observed here only weeks later during Spring 2020.
